      <description>It has been almost 5â€‰years since the Basque militant group ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna) disarmed and disbanded following a bloody campaign that lasted almost 60â€‰years. In Counter-terror by proxy: The Spanish Stateâ€™s illicit war with ETA, Emmanuel-Pierre Guittet takes a deep dive into a specific period in the conflict (1983-1987), during which a group of state-sponsored mercenaries carried out their own brutal campaign that spanned the French-Spanish border. The group was called GAL (Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberacion) and its targets were suspected ETA members and supporters.</description>
